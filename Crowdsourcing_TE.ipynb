      "        \"I, too, have the eye contact problem! Here is what I have learned:\\n\\n1) Eye contact should be brief, because people get pretty uncomfortable if you keep looking at them (learned the hard way). Look at them, look away, look over their shoulder, look at their face, etc. Blink! This one is a little tough for me because if you move your eyes too much then people may think your shifty, and if you don't move your eyes enough then you must be a creep. Practice makes it easier. \\n\\n2) It usually works to look near their eyes, like at the ear, eyebrow, nose, glasses. It can be really hard to tell (at least in my experience) when someone is looking you exactly in the eye, especially from a distance of 3-6 feet. Or farther. \\n\\n3) Practice with someone you know, like a friend. You don't even have to tell them if you don't want to! \\n\\n4) Make silly faces with someone you know really well, like your son or husband. Stare them deep in the eyeballs and be goofy! This helps your body, your subconscious, understand that sometimes nice feelings happen from eye contact and it's not always stressful. Then it's easier to relax when making eye contact with acquaintances and strangers. \\n\\n5) Oh yeah start small! Don't worry about maintaining eye contact for most of a conversation, start with a few glances here and there.\",\n",
