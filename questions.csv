Anyone have Skype?,"Well, like the subject says, anyone have Skype and are they up to talking to other people?
 

 I know that it doesn't really seem like it would go hand-in-hand with Autism, but perhaps it might be another way for people with Autism to communicate with each other and just hang out and talk. And who knows, perhaps it might help in being sociable with other people."
"Dr Who, is he Autistic?","I watch Dr Who each week and I keep picking out typical characteristics of the doctor that are traits of autism. He appears to be very extravagant, takes things literally and surprises people when he bumbles on about some kind of alien technology. This seemed especially clear with this weeks episode with James Corden. 
 Do you think the character The Doctor is autistic? He is certainly on the ""another forum"". 
 PS. He is called The Doctor, not Dr Who. If you refer to him as Dr Who I can guarantee the following post will be a correction, simply because we all enjoy correcting people so much!"
Extreme anxiety when my partner is away from home,"If my partner goes out alone - either on foot or in the car - I have almost unbearable anxiety until he gets back or telephones me to say he's home. While he's away it doesn't matter how much I try to concentrate on other things I constantly think of all the possible bad scenaros. It's an extra stress to have to hide it from him. 
 

 Am I alone in having this problem and if not can anyone suggest ways of dealing with it?"
First day back in school,"Hi. I went to my first college class this summer, and I started having a panic attack even before I got into the class room. When I finally got in, I started pouring sweat and shaking for about an hour and some change, during the entire lecture. I just couldn't control myself, and I felt extremely embarrassed about how I must have looked, covered in sweat, shaking, and looking totally out of control. So, as soon as I came home, I tried to find a forum to talk about this, and found this forum. If you have any ideas about what to do to make this better, please let me know."
Haldol and Cogentin (What is your Medication)?,"Anyone here ever take Haldol or Cogentin? Also, what is your medication of choice? Of what are you on and do you like it? Side effects? Please feel free to discuss any Meds here.
 

 Thanks

How do you cope with power cuts?,"Just recently, I've been having power cuts at my house and I haven't been able to post when I'm at home and I must say, it really sucked that I actually got to the point where I wanted to actually scream, shout or swear and I managed to survive 3 days of it. 
 

 Anyways, how do you cope with power cuts?"
Manhattan Project,"I hadn't seen the Manhattan Project in a long time. It made me laugh at how much fun they make stealing Plutonium, making a nuke, grand theft auto, and evading police look. Could this be indicative of the economic times during the 80's?"
Negative reactions towards Asperger's.,"So just recently, I told who I thought as a close group of peers ( my nursing clinical group and instructor) that my brother has Asperger's and I have self diagnosed myself, as well. The first reaction I got was ""you aren't going to bring in a gun and shoot everyone are you?""......... I didn't even know HOW to respond to that! I guess it was them associating what the media has posted about that kid who shot those school children. I am not prone to violence and neither is my brother. I get angry like everyone else in the world but I couldn't hurt a fly. My question is, if and when I get a diagnosis, should I even tell anyone other than family??? I am actively involved in autism awareness but so many people have the wrong idea about this! Help!"
"Noisy neighbours making me go insane, any advice?","Recently we've got new neighbours who live above us, in an old wooden house... who seem to love having parties. This is fine... but, well to put it in perspective its currently 1.30am local time and the music and their screaming is only getting louder. My fiance doesn't seem to mind it, but it really is driving me insane. He's watching the rugby in the next room, with the tv on about full volume to ""cancel out"" their noise upstairs?  
 

 I really don't know what to do, I've tried earplugs, headphones, even asked him if I could call noise control and he said 'You have to be more respectful of others'  
 

 Any advice? I haven't really encountered this problem much before - happy to give ya all my love and respect  
 

 Oh and isn't that emoticon fantastic... really want a brick wall right now lol"
PDD-NOS and dating?,"I recently went to the hospital and got psychological testing proving that I have PDD NOS. I am 23 and have only had one girlfriend and it only lasted about a week. Well recently I have started seeing a new girl. I don't know the social norms and speed for dating whatsoever. Luckily this girl is pretty laid back and knows all of this. But tonight we kissed for the first time, and she said that I was going to fast. I am confused by this. Is this a coordination problem? Or is there any way that I can get tips on this without having to practice on her and embarrassing myself? This was only the second date. So I guess it's moving along normally? She's a very experienced dater.. So I don't know what to do..? I am asking this in this forum because I asked the same thing in another forum and the moderator moved to the personality disorder forum... Which didn't make sense to me and doesn't make me happy. Hoping you guys have better feedback."
Possible asperger's? Bad social skills and cannot maintain eye contact.,"It's only been the last year or two that I've even noticed that there is something off about the way I socialize and communicate with other people. I only looked into asperger's because I found out I am likely to have celiac disease. Anyways, I've always gotten very anxious in large groups of people, I noticed that it was extreme when I had my baby shower a year and a half ago. It was all I could do just to make it through the day. Anyway, I have discussed a lot of my issues socializing with my husband and he jokingly told me to take the asperger's test online, and I scored 38. Since then I've looked more into it and realize I have a lot of other things that relate to asperger's. For example, I don't look at anyone directly, except my very close family...my mom, sisters, husband, and son. That's about it. The last few months my husband has decided to point out to me when I'm not looking at someone (not while with the person, but later) when they are talking to me. We've been in and out of doctors a lot lately and he thinks that I make them uncomfortable because they will be looking right at me talking to me and I guess I just look at the floor or my son. I never really realized it until he started pointing it out, but now I notice and sometimes try to look at people directly but it is very hard for me to do. He also thinks that people think I'm being rude or unfriendly because I don't look at them, but I usually don't notice I do it, and even when I do it's hard to control. Just venting I guess, hoping to get some tips as to how to maintain eye contact?"
Problem with friendships...,"Ever since I was a child, I've been overly attached to friends I feel very close to. I get jealous when they hang out with other people. I become anxious and upset when they don't respond to my phone calls or emails. And I become crushed when they ignore my friend requests for Facebook. 
 Recently I found an old friend on Facebook. I sent her a friend request, but she didn't respond. She did respond to request from my other friends right away, though. After a few days, she ignored my request. I was really disappointed because I was hoping to hang out with her again (and I have a secret crush on her.) But what really set me off was when I saw a photo of three of my friends hanging out with her at a restaurant, without me. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. I cried that night and the next morning I even contemplated suicide (I know this seems a little dramatic, but that's how I really felt.) 
 I don't want to be overly attached to other people anymore. What should I do to have healthier friendships?"
Problems with phones,"Hi there - i am new to this forum so bear with me 
 

 Does anyone else there have problems with making/receiving phone calls from people they don't know? 
 

 I can talk on the phone with friends, but anything involving phone calls to unknown people is a major problem for me. This has been a problem in jobs all my life."
Regretful/Guilty Thoughts?,"You know when you're just sitting around, minding your own business, not doing much, then all of a sudden a wave of regrets washes over you?!
 

 All those these bad thoughts you wish you could block out take over your mind, and then you feel yourself get very angry or guilty? 
 

 Like, let's say you think about something somebody said to you a couple years ago. You know it doesn't matter, but you can't help thinking in the back of your mind, ""I need to get revenge on that person, I hope they feel horrible.""
 

 Or it can be the other way around, you could regret saying something to someone in the past, then you feel guilty and unpleasant. You think, ""I wished I would've reacted differently or said something else."" 
 

 Know what I mean? Every day these thoughts enter my head, and I feel myself heat up and my heart races. I just calm down by taking deep breaths, listening to my music, or drawing.  
 

 Isn't it frustrating though? Do you have these thoughts/regrets? How do you usually get rid of them?"
School Dances,"Last night I went to one of my school's three annual dances.  
 

 Big mistake. I spent the entire time checking my watch, wanting desperately to leave so that I could go home and read. There were too many people, there was too much talking, I felt so utterly exposed and overstimulated. *shudder* When I finally got picked up my father said that I had an ""oversocialized"" face on, which surprised me because I didn't know there was such a thing. I don't think that's an experience I ever want to replicate if I don't get railroaded into it. 
 

 Similar problems, stories, anyone?"
Vocalizing internal thoughts,"As some of you may have deduced, I have aspergers. This really doesn't bother me for the most part. I prefer be alone than with other people, and although I've made the occasional social gaff with schoolmates, I seem to get along fine on and professional level and with adults. However, one thing I hate is that I am constantly vocalizing my internal thoughts. This has been very severe, and I can't seem to control it. It has led to some of the most humiliating moments of my life. Is there some way to treat this? I really want this to stop before I go off for college in a few weeks."
Watched any good anime lately?,"Anyone here watched any good anime lately? I went through a period of not watching very much anime, but now I think I'm getting back into it a little bit. I've started catching up on the most recent Black Jack series on Crunchyroll, and I've been enjoying it so far.  
 

 I've also been meaning to start watching Eden of the East sometime since I've heard good things about it."
Your opinion of this song?,"I am blown away by this track and also the way Bowie handles the lyrics. I'm curious as to how many of you people ""dig"" it. I've been a Pat Metheny fan for some time now from before he did this track with Bowie (in the eighties). He also inspires my own music experimentation as a lot of Pat Metheny group tracks are instrumental.
 

 I also like the video part and the subtle chord changes. The song is from a film that deals with espionage and somehow Bowie worked with PMG to make this track for the movie.

aspies and facebook,"Lately I've been looking at the list of people on my facebook and getting a bit depressed over it. Mostly because other than family its made up largely of people who check their profiles once a month or old school friends I just added because I knew them in school. 
 

 It depresses me a bit because people who I thought of as friends have wandered off or taken offense. There is no real friends on my facebook page and as I don't have a lot of other social interaction at present I guess it kind of reminds me of how isolated I am. 
 

 Does anyone else get a bit depressed over their pitiful facebook pages? I look at my husbands some times and his is full of interesting things to see and read and mine just seems to be full of ads and posts from groups."
i was terrified of balloons,"when i was a kid. my babysitter brought a balloon and said she's going to fill it with air, so i told her to go to another room so i wont get hurt by its flying pieces in case it blew up. and she asked me, ""what do you think it is, a bomb?""
 

 i was also scared of the vacuum cleaner because of the noise. in order to get over my fear, i held it by its tube and dragged it around the house, and when my mother asked what was i doing i said i'm taking it for a walk.
 

 anyone else scared of inanimate objects? or is it noises? when taken to a noisy place as a child, i was absolutely so terrified i was paralyzed with fear."
