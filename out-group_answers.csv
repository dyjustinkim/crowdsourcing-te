Anyone have Skype?,"Well, like the subject says, anyone have Skype and are they up to talking to other people?

In your case, i think it would work great. I would start off by spreading the word on social media in groups on facebook that deal with autism. that would eliminate anyone who shouldnt be there and help the whole skype experience be better because you are a group of people who are looking to take advantage of technology while helping members cope with certain fears that they may have with social interacton. i say start a group spread the word in facebook groups dealing with same issues and watch it grow from there and watch the friends come in.",,,,,

"Dr Who, is he Autistic?","I watch Dr Who each week and I keep picking out typical characteristics of the doctor that are traits of autism.

I explained to my family my problem and they offered to help. I started practicing in front of family, friends, neighbors. I also would stand up and read over and over what I was going to present for days before it was due. This made it much easier to talk and have my sentences flow easy because I read it so many times. The day my presentation was due I was very calm and confident because I knew what I was going to say and already practiced many times. I did very well and started doing better and better as I went on. Main thing is this. Practice and make eye contact.

Bill",Not confident at all,,No knowledge of these medications,The question does not address for what symptoms or conditions the user is taking them.

"Noisy neighbours making me go insane, any advice?","Recently we've got new neighbours who live above us, in an old wooden house... who seem to love having parties.

First, there's a chance that they don't realize they're bothering you. Try talking to them and letting them know how you feel.

Just venting I guess, hoping to get some tips as to how to maintain eye contact?",Somewhat confident,,"I have had much trouble making eye contact, and learned many things the hard way - through people being upset at me and tme asking lots of questions when I eventually gained some confidence.","I, too, have the eye contact problem! Here is what I have learned:

1) Eye contact should be brief, because people get pretty uncomfortable if you keep looking at them (learned the hard way). Look at them, look away, look over their shoulder, look at their face, etc. Blink! This one is a little tough for me because if you move your eyes too much then people may think your shifty, and if you don't move your eyes enough then you must be a creep. Practice makes it easier. 

2) It usually works to look near their eyes, like at the ear, eyebrow, nose, glasses. It can be really hard to tell (at least in my experience) when someone is looking you exactly in the eye, especially from a distance of 3-6 feet. Or farther. 

3) Practice with someone you know, like a friend. You don't even have to tell them if you don't want to! 

4) Make silly faces with someone you know really well, like your son or husband. Stare them deep in the eyeballs and be goofy! This helps your body, your subconscious, understand that sometimes nice feelings happen from eye contact and it's not always stressful. Then it's easier to relax when making eye contact with acquaintances and strangers. 

5) Oh yeah start small! Don't worry about maintaining eye contact for most of a conversation, start with a few glances here and there.",,,,,

Problem with friendships...,"Ever since I was a child, I've been overly attached to friends I feel very close to.  I get jealous when they hang out with other people.  I become anxious and upset when they don't respond to my phone calls or emails.  And I become crushed when they ignore my friend requests for Facebook. 
Recently I found an old friend on Facebook.  I sent her a friend request, but she didn't respond.  She did respond to request from my other friends right away, though.  After a few days, she ignored my request.  I was really disappointed because I was hoping to hang out with her again (and I have a secret crush on her.)  But what really set me off was when I saw a photo of three of my friends hanging out with her at a restaurant, without me.  That was the straw that broke the camel's back.  I cried that night and the next morning I even contemplated suicide (I know this seems a little dramatic, but that's how I really felt.)

All those these bad thoughts you wish you could block out take over your mind, and then you feel yourself get very angry or guilty? 

Like, let's say you think about something somebody said to you a couple years ago.  You know it doesn't matter, but you can't help thinking in the back of your mind, ""I need to get revenge on that person, I hope they feel horrible.""

Or it can be the other way around, you could regret saying something to someone in the past, then you feel guilty and unpleasant.  You think, ""I wished I would've reacted differently or said something else."" 

Know what I mean?  Every day these thoughts enter my head, and I feel myself heat up and my heart races.  I just calm down by taking deep breaths, listening to my music, or drawing.   

Isn't it frustrating though?  Do you have these thoughts/regrets?  How do you usually get rid of them?",Very confident,,Everyone experiences regret and holds onto past confrontations.,"Everyone deals with thoughts similar to yours. ""What if"" is a heavy question that can quickly lead to doubt and depression concerning life choices. Often people remember scenarios that made them angry and people that wronged them. The only answer is to either confront them and talk it out with the person out how you are still holding onto feelings of anger towards them for something they once did. You'll always wish you had the perfect comeback to the jerk from your school or your annoying co-worker. You either have to confront these feelings or try to let it go. Odds are they might not remember the scenario like you still do and it might be best to just forgive them if you don't have the capability to explain your feelings of enmity to them. If you acted poorly in a situation try to make amends now and tell the person you feel bad for that interaction. They will most likely appreciate this kindness even if they aren't holding a grudge towards you.",,,,,

I used to have terrible anxiety and when a place started getting too crowded, I couldn't wait to leave. I tackled it with school dances by taking a couple friends with me who understood my situation. That way, I was able to dance with my own friends, talk with them, and they helped me to feel secure. They could also walk outside with me if I needed a break and I didn't have to stand out there and be alone. Worst case scenario, I would text/call someone to come get me! You don't have to completely immerse yourself here you're not comfortable. Take baby steps. 15 minutes at the first event/dance, 30 at the next, and keep adding time until you're comfortable.
