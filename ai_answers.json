And who knows, perhaps it might help in being sociable with other people.": [
            "Yes, Skype can be a helpful platform for people with autism to communicate and connect. It offers a way to talk face-to-face virtually without the pressure of in-person meetings, which some might find less stressful. It could be a good tool for socializing and building connections in a comfortable environment.",
            "I think Skype might be useful for people with autism as it allows for remote communication, which might be less overwhelming. If others in the autism community are open to it, it could be a good way to connect and socialize. However, I can't confirm if many use Skype specifically.",
            "Skype is definitely a tool that people with autism can use to communicate with others. Many find online conversations easier since they can control the pace and environment. Having a Skype group or chat could help autistic individuals socialize and feel part of a community.",
            "I don't really know much about whether Skype is commonly used by people with autism to talk with others. It seems possible, but I can't really say for sure if it works well or not.",
            "Yes, many individuals with autism use Skype or similar video chat apps to communicate and build social skills. Because it provides a controlled environment with visual and audio cues, it can help those who find face-to-face interactions challenging. It's a great suggestion to use Skype for socializing and support."

        "I watch Dr Who each week and I keep picking out typical characteristics of the doctor that are traits of autism. He appears to be very extravagant, takes things literally and surprises people when he bumbles on about some kind of alien technology. This seemed especially clear with this weeks episode with James Corden. \n Do you think the character The Doctor is autistic? He is certainly on the \"another forum\". \n PS. He is called The Doctor, not Dr Who. If you refer to him as Dr Who I can guarantee the following post will be a correction, simply because we all enjoy correcting people so much!": [
            "The Doctor displaying literal thinking and surprise at alien technology could be interpreted as autistic traits, but the character is intentionally eccentric and alien, so it's hard to say definitively. I think it's more about storytelling than portraying autism. So while some traits may seem similar, it might not be accurate to label The Doctor as autistic.",
            "I think some behaviors of The Doctor might resemble traits observed in autism, like literal thinking and social differences. However, The Doctor is a fictional time traveler with alien origins, so behaviors might be more related to that rather than autism. Overall, I wouldn't say he is autistic but it's an interesting observation.",
            "I don't think I can confidently say if The Doctor is autistic or not. It's a fictional character with many different traits, so it's probably best left to fans who analyze the show more closely.",
            "The Doctor does exhibit some behaviors that overlap with autistic traits, such as literal interpretation of things and social quirks. However, since he's an alien character designed for unpredictability and eccentricity, it likely isn't meant to represent autism explicitly. It's an interesting perspective but probably not meant to be an autistic portrayal.",
            "While some actions of The Doctor could be seen as autistic traits, it's important to remember that the character is an alien with a unique personality that might not be relatable to human conditions. Therefore, it's hard to label him as autistic. The eccentricities are probably more about his alien nature and storytelling purposes."

Remember, many people face anxiety and you are not alone.",

            "Panic attacks can be really overwhelming, especially in new or stressful situations. You might find it useful to prepare before class by practicing grounding techniques, like focusing on your senses or counting breaths. Talking to a counselor or therapist can also help you develop coping strategies. Also, try to remind yourself it's okay to feel nervous and that it gets easier with time. You might even talk to your professor about how you feel to see if accommodations are possible.",

I don't personally take these medications, but side effects can include drowsiness or dry mouth. It's best to discuss with a doctor for personalized advice.",
            "I know that Haldol (haloperidol) is an antipsychotic sometimes used for severe behavioral issues and that Cogentin (benztropine) helps with side effects like tremors. People's experiences vary a lot, though. Some medications can help with irritability or aggression in autism, but side effects like drowsiness or movement problems are common. It's important to consult a healthcare professional before starting or changing meds.",

People on Haldol might experience side effects like drowsiness, restlessness, or muscle stiffness, which Cogentin helps reduce. Medication effectiveness varies, so it's important to monitor closely with a doctor.",

            "When the power goes out, I usually try to stay calm by focusing on other activities that don't need electricity, like reading a book or going outside for a walk. I also keep flashlights and battery-powered devices handy. Planning ahead by charging devices and having backup power sources helps a lot. Taking deep breaths or talking with someone helps reduce frustration too.",
            "I imagine that during power cuts, it's important to stay calm and distract yourself with offline activities like puzzles or drawing. Using candles or flashlights safely can help provide light. Making sure to keep hydrated and resting until the power returns might be good. It's probably helpful to remind yourself that it's temporary.",
            "To cope with power cuts, I prepare by having battery-powered lights and some charged portable devices. If possible, I use backup power banks or a generator. I also try to accept that it's out of my control, which helps reduce frustration. Keeping a set of activities that don't rely on electronics, like journaling or meditation, is useful. Staying connected with others by phone when possible can also help.",

During the outage, I focus on relaxing activities that don't need power like reading, drawing, or talking with family.

        "I hadn't seen the Manhattan Project in a long time. It made me laugh at how much fun they make stealing Plutonium, making a nuke, grand theft auto, and evading police look. Could this be indicative of the economic times during the 80's?": [
            "The Manhattan Project was actually a WWII-era secret project to develop nuclear weapons, not something from the 80's. The movie seems to be making a comedic take on serious topics like nuclear material theft and crime. The way those themes are presented might reflect some stereotypes or attitudes from the 80s, which was a time with economic concerns, rising crime rates, and lots of action movies. So yes, the fun portrayal might be influenced by the economic and cultural environment of that decade.",
            "The actual Manhattan Project was during World War II, not the 1980s. The movie probably uses that name for comedic effect. The way stealing plutonium and grand theft auto are portrayed humorously could reflect the 1980s when crime films and heist comedies were popular. Economic struggles and pop culture in the 80s often joked about crime and corruption, so the movie could be indicative of those times.",
            "I don't really know the details about the Manhattan Project or its connection to the 80s. It sounds like the movie is making a joke about serious topics, but I'm not sure how that ties to the economic times during that decade.",
            "The Manhattan Project was an actual WWII project, but the movie you're referring to is likely a comedy that exaggerates crime and theft for laughs. In the 1980s, crime and economic uncertainty were common themes in media, and many comedies poked fun at these issues. So the humorous portrayal of stealing plutonium and evading police could be reflecting the economic and social climate of the 80s.",
            "The original Manhattan Project was a serious WWII government program, so the movie's comedic take is more about satire or fun. It might reflect 80s economic conditions indirectly because that era had many films making light of crime and risky behavior, turning them into entertaining stories rather than serious issues."

        "So just recently, I told who I thought as a close group of peers ( my nursing clinical group and instructor) that my brother has Asperger's and I have self diagnosed myself, as well. The first reaction I got was \"you aren't going to bring in a gun and shoot everyone are you?\"......... I didn't even know HOW to respond to that! I guess it was them associating what the media has posted about that kid who shot those school children. I am not prone to violence and neither is my brother. I get angry like everyone else in the world but I couldn't hurt a fly. My question is, if and when I get a diagnosis, should I even tell anyone other than family??? I am actively involved in autism awareness but so many people have the wrong idea about this! Help!": [
            "It's unfortunate that your peers reacted that way; unfortunately, many people have misconceptions shaped by media portrayals. Whether to disclose your diagnosis outside family is a personal choice. You might want to share with those you trust or who are supportive. Being involved in autism awareness is great, and educating others gradually might help reduce stigma. You are not obliged to tell anyone unless you feel comfortable.",
            "It sounds like your group had a very wrong and hurtful reaction. Maybe if you get an official diagnosis, you could tell close friends who understand and accept it instead of everyone. It's sad people associate autism with violence because that is not true. It might be better not to tell people who might judge you unfairly but keep educating those open to learning.",
            "Negative reactions like the one you experienced are unfortunately common. It's important to protect your own mental health. You don't have to disclose your diagnosis unless you want to.

Focus on building understanding with patient, compassionate people.",

            "You shouldn't feel pressured to share your diagnosis with people who aren't supportive or understanding. If you get an official diagnosis, telling close friends and family might help you focus on a supportive network. Sadly, many have misconceptions linking autism and violence, which is inaccurate. Continue with autism awareness and set boundaries on who you tell."

Since earplugs and headphones aren't fully helping, perhaps you could try discussing your need for quiet with your fiance more openly to get support. You might also consider contacting noise control or a local authority just to understand your rights about noise hours, even if your fiance is hesitant. Maybe white noise machines or playing calming music at a low volume could help mask the noise in a less intrusive way than the TV. Lastly, if the situation continues long-term, maybe looking into soundproofing solutions or rearranging your room away from the noise might help.",

Calling noise control might be an option if it's really late and the noise is excessive. You could also try to look for local laws about quiet hours and share them with your fiancÃ© to help him understand your frustration. Sometimes meditation or deep breathing helps with irritation from noise too.",
            "Dealing with noisy neighbors, especially late at night, can be very stressful. Since the house is old and wooden, sound can easily travel. Besides earplugs, you might try a white noise machine or a fan to mask the sounds. It could also help to have a calm conversation with your neighbors during the day explaining how their noise affects you. If that doesn't work and the noise keeps happening past local quiet hours, contacting noise control or local authorities is justified. You might also want to gently talk again to your fiancÃ© about how important it is for your wellbeing.",

Since your fiancÃ© isn't bothered, maybe you need to find ways to separate yourself, like spending some time away in a quieter place. You could talk with neighbors nicely during the day to ask if they could keep it down after a certain time.

If the noise regularly exceeds quiet times allowed by local rules, you can consider reporting it, but try to do so calmly to avoid tension.

Social norms around dating can vary widely between people, but typically, it's okay to take things slower if your partner prefers. This isn't necessarily a coordination problem; it could just be about individual comfort levels. An option is to openly communicate with her about what pace she's comfortable with. You could also look into online resources or books about social skills and dating for people on the autism spectrum to increase your understanding without feeling embarrassed.",
            "From what I know, it's important to consider your partner's feelings and comfort.

Also, reading about social cues and dating tips for people with autism might be helpful, but practicing with your partner is probably the best way to learn.",
            "What your girlfriend said about moving fast is likely more about her personal comfort level and the natural pacing of relationships rather than a coordination problem. Many people prefer to slow down physical affection early on. Since she's laid back and understands your situation, it would be good to talk openly about what feels right for both of you. There are also social skills groups and online communities where people share tips on navigating relationships with PDD-NOS.

            "It's common for individuals with PDD-NOS to find social cues and dating norms confusing. Moving fast in a relationship can sometimes make the other person uncomfortable, regardless of diagnosis. Your girlfriend saying you went 'too fast' likely means she prefers to slow down the intimacy. It's not necessarily a coordination problem but possibly about emotional pacing.

For example, I don't look at anyone directly, except my very close family...my mom, sisters, husband, and son. That's about it. The last few months my husband has decided to point out to me when I'm not looking at someone (not while with the person, but later) when they are talking to me. We've been in and out of doctors a lot lately and he thinks that I make them uncomfortable because they will be looking right at me talking to me and I guess I just look at the floor or my son.

            "Difficulty with eye contact is a common challenge for people with Asperger's or autism spectrum disorder. It might help to practice in low-pressure situations, like with your close family first, gradually increasing exposure to others. You could also try focusing on other parts of the face, like the nose or mouth, to give the appearance of eye contact without discomfort. If anxiety is a big factor, relaxation techniques before social events might help. Consider discussing with a therapist who specializes in autism for personalized strategies.",
            "It sounds like your difficulty with eye contact might be linked to social anxiety or aspects of Asperger's. One idea is to not force direct eye contact if it's uncomfortable, but instead look near the person's eyes. It can also help to explain to others that this is a difficulty for you, so they understand you're not being rude. Maybe a speech therapist or counselor could provide exercises or coping strategies tailored to your needs.",
            "Maintaining eye contact can be very challenging for people with Asperger's. A helpful tip is to practice with people you trust, starting with brief moments of eye contact and gradually increasing. Using distraction techniques, like glancing at the bridge of the nose, can make it less stressful. It's also useful to inform people around you so they don't misinterpret your lack of eye contact as rudeness. Therapy focusing on social skills might be beneficial too.",
            "I'm not sure I can give good advice because I don't know much about Asperger's. Maybe trying to look at people when talking to them could help, but if it's hard, maybe a doctor or therapist could give better suggestions. It might also help to talk openly with your husband or family about how you feel.",
            "It's quite common for people with Asperger's or on the autism spectrum to find eye contact uncomfortable. One approach is to practice eye contact in a safe environment with close family, like you mentioned. You can also try to shift your gaze slightly off to the side instead of directly in the eyes.

Well recently I have started seeing a new girl. I don't know the social norms and speed for dating whatsoever. Luckily this girl is pretty laid back and knows all of this. But tonight we kissed for the first time, and she said that I was going to fast. I am confused by this. Is this a coordination problem? Or is there any way that I can get tips on this without having to practice on her and embarrassing myself? This was only the second date. So I guess it's moving along normally? She's a very experienced dater.. So I don't know what to do..?

Dating speed varies a lot between people, so it's important to communicate openly with your partner. Since she said you were moving too fast after the first kiss on the second date, it might be good to slow down and ask her what pace she's comfortable with. This isn't necessarily a coordination problem but more about understanding her feelings and boundaries. You could also look for online resources or books on social skills and dating for people with autism to get tips without feeling embarrassed.",

        "It's only been the last year or two that I've even noticed that there is something off about the way I socialize and communicate with other people. I only looked into asperger's because I found out I am likely to have celiac disease. Anyways, I've always gotten very anxious in large groups of people, I noticed that it was extreme when I had my baby shower a year and a half ago. It was all I could do just to make it through the day. Anyway, I have discussed a lot of my issues socializing with my husband and he jokingly told me to take the asperger's test online, and I scored 38. Since then I've looked more into it and realize I have a lot of other things that relate to asperger's. For example, I don't look at anyone directly, except my very close family...my mom, sisters, husband, and son. That's about it. The last few months my husband has decided to point out to me when I'm not looking at someone (not while with the person, but later) when they are talking to me. We've been in and out of doctors a lot lately and he thinks that I make them uncomfortable because they will be looking right at me talking to me and I guess I just look at the floor or my son. I never really realized it until he started pointing it out, but now I notice and sometimes try to look at people directly but it is very hard for me to do. He also thinks that people think I'm being rude or unfriendly because I don't look at them, but I usually don't notice I do it, and even when I do it's hard to control. Just venting I guess, hoping to get some tips as to how to maintain eye contact?": [
            "Difficulty with eye contact and social anxiety can be common in people with Asperger's or autism. It might help to practice brief eye contact in comfortable settings, gradually increasing duration. Also, explaining your discomfort to close people can reduce misunderstandings. If it feels overwhelming, consider speaking to a therapist or counselor who specializes in autism to develop coping strategies.",
            "It sounds like you might have traits associated with Asperger's, but only a professional can diagnose. For eye contact, maybe try focusing on a spot near the person's eyes instead of directly looking at them, which can feel less intense. Also, letting people know about your discomfort might help reduce misunderstandings. Seeking professional advice is probably a good idea.",
            "Maintaining eye contact can be difficult for many on the autism spectrum. One tip is to practice in low-pressure environments and try to hold eye contact for just a few seconds at a time. You might also explain to people that this is challenging for you, so they understand it's not rudeness. Working with a therapist skilled in autism can provide personalized strategies to improve social communication.",

Also, preparing for the class ahead of time, like visiting the classroom or reviewing the syllabus, can reduce stress. Remember, you're not alone, and many students face similar feelings.",

Breathing exercises or grounding techniques (like focusing on your surroundings) can be useful. Maybe talking to a counselor at school could provide more tailored support. I once helped a friend who had panic in social situations by practicing mindfulness and small breaks, which seemed to help a bit.",
            "Panic attacks can be managed with some strategies. You might try paced breathing (inhale for 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 4) when you feel anxious. It helps calm your nervous system. Also, preparing yourself for class by arriving early, knowing the classroom layout, and having a support person or counselor on call might reduce stress. Many colleges offer resources for students with anxiety or autism. I have a family member who found that pacing outside before class and having water helped.",

Maybe explain your situation to your professor or a counselor to get some accommodations. Also, bringing a fidget toy or something to help focus your attention might distract from panic symptoms. From what I've seen online, many people find gradual exposure to the environment helpful over time.",
            "I think a key step is to recognize panic symptoms early and use grounding techniques like focusing on five things you see or hear. Avoid caffeine and try to get good sleep before classes. It's important to tell a trusted person, like a counselor or support friend, about what you're experiencing. I read that some people benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy or apps designed to manage anxiety. Maybe see if your school offers counseling services."
